# https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/
# Each service defined in docker-compose.yml must specify exactly one of
# image or build. Other keys are optional, and are analogous to their
# docker run command-line counterparts.
#
# As with docker run, options specified in the Dockerfile (e.g., CMD,
# EXPOSE, VOLUME, ENV) are respected by default - you don't need to
# specify them again in docker-compose.yml.

    # We need to mount a physical dir in the HOST onto the key store in pfcon. This dir
    # is given by the STOREBASE env variable substitution. The keystore can be specified
    # by the --storeBase flag during development.
    # Since pfcon spins off containers of its own it also needs to mount storeBase dir
    # (where it shares the data) into the spawned container. This directory is passed
    # in the STOREBASE env variable.
