# https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/
# Each service defined in docker-compose.yml must specify exactly one of
# image or build. Other keys are optional, and are analogous to their
# docker run command-line counterparts.
#
# As with docker run, options specified in the Dockerfile (e.g., CMD,
# EXPOSE, VOLUME, ENV) are respected by default - you don't need to
# specify them again in docker-compose.yml.
